# Property Management System Web API  - PMS Web API
Pms Web Api -  Honours Project (Software Engineering ). Link >>>

This is the API for my Honours Project in Software Engineering (Cos 730). Throughout the project, i commonly refer to my system as PMS, 
this is the accronym for Property Management System.

The API is linked to an Azure App service. Through Azure Devops, i set up automated rolling builds which are triggered by 
any new commit to the master branch
